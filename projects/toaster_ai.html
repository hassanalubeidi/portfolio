		    <p>A hardware hack built for <a href="https://www.neontribe.co.uk/untangled-2016/">Untangled - Neontribe</a>. <a href="https://github.com/neontribe/toastAI">Github repo</a>.</p>

				<p>ToastAI was a challenge more of management than software engineering. I volunteered for a week at Neontribe as a mentor for their Untangled hackathon, which is a week long event where a group of 4-5 under 18s prototype, build and present a computing based hack.</p>

				<p>Firstly, the teams came up with ideas for their projects. We (the mentors) let the children exercise their creativity while at the same time providing insight for feasability of projects. Once they'd selected an idea, we guided them through the technology needed to build it. We also taught them the basics of things like stack overflow so that they could debug independently. </p>

				<p>The team also came up with <a href="https://github.com/neontribe/toastAI/blob/master/user-stories.md">user stories</a> to guide them through design decisions</p>

				<p>We then set about designing the system and interface. I guided mostly in the creation of a web application, while the other mentors helped with the hardware side of things. </p>

				<p>We ended up going for an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> front-end with <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase database</a>. Reasons were that some of the kids had a good grasp of modern web development while others were completely new to it. Those familiar would work on creating API endpoints and linking them to Angular through services while the newbies get to learn things like HTML and CSS while getting a simple overview of how the system works. </p>
				
				<p>On the hardware side of things, we attached a Servo onto the toaster, controlled by an Arduino. We then had a Raspberry PI host the web interface, and send commands to the Arduino.</p>

				<p>Finally, the team presented the finished hack to an audience of about 20 tech workers from Norwich. It would have been a resounding success, but unfortunately we set the setting for the Servo too low, so the toaster never actually started toasting. However, it was a huge success in that it tought the children some very valuable skills and hopefully inspired them to create their own projects.</p>

				<p>For me, it was a very new experience, as I had to lay all hands off the keyboard for most of the time. Managing the project was challenging at times but hugely rewarding.</p>
