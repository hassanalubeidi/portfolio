		    <p>SmartLearn&mdash;Custom learning platfrom built for <a href="http://www.inspirationtrust.org/page/?title=Sir+Isaac+Newton+Sixth+Form&pid=79">Sir Isaac Newton Sixth Form</a>.</p>

				<p>What started off as a personal project to keep track of my learning at sixth form grew to be an innovative learning platform, and even a small development team.</p>

				<p>The web application consisted of an Angular front end, and Rails backend.</p>
				<p > For the front end, I used the great <a href="http://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic-UI</a> library as it's fantastic to develop with and looks great.  I used <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">grunt</a> as my task runner, as it pairs nicely with Angular. Speaking of which, this was my first large application built with Angular. I created services/ factories for easy interaction with the backend API, and used UI router to extend Angular's routing capabilities. </p>

				<p>As for the back end, I tried to keep it as light and predictable as possible. While Rails is generally considered a 'heavy' framework, I tried to use only its Active Record features mainly. I used the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/cerebris/jsonapi-resources">JSONAPI::Resources</a> gem to create a rigid and predictable way to interact with the API.</p>

				<p>Server side, I decided to use AWS to host both the front and back end. Main justification was ease of use and (relatively) low price.</p>

				<p>I truly loved creating this, and kept growing it and growing it, with more feautres than it's reasonanle to write here. I especially enjoyed creating a small team of developers within my school, getting them on board with the ideas of the application, and working with them.</p>

				<p>The site as of now is down, because the whole project is being rewritten by others within the team. I am no longer contributing much to it due to a heavy university schedule (although I'd love to!). </p>
